# JavaScript 2 Resit

## Goal
The goal for this assignment is to use your skills in JavaScript to create a working shopping cart.

## Brief

You have been tasked with creating a working shopping cart for Nice Cream, an online ice cream store which allows users to create custom made ice cream.
Users can choose: the base flavour (vanilla or chocolate), the size they want, and any additions.

## Level 1

### product.html

- The user can choose their flavour, the size pot, and their additions. When ‘Add to Cart’ is clicked, the ‘Shopping Cart’ section should be revealed on the page, and the user’s choice should be shown in the div with class ‘cart__products’ including the price for that item.
- Users should be able to add multiple items to the shopping cart.
- The total should be updated each time an item is added to the cart.
- When the user clicks ‘Checkout’ the total for the page should be saved to localStorage

### checkout.html

- The total on products.html should be displayed in the total section on Checkout

## Level 2 (optional)

### product.html

- Users should be able to remove items from the shopping cart. Add a minus symbol beside each 'cost' and when it is clicked, remove the item from the cart.

### checkout.html

- Add an Edit link back to product.html where users can update their shopping cart. You will need to save their original selection in localStorage.
